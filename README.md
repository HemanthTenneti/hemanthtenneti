# Hey there! 👋🏼
I'm **Hemanth Tenneti**, an enthusiast in design and intermediate programmer on here to find ways to improve.
Here's some things about me,
- 📑 I'm currently about to finish my high-school education. 
- ✨ Exploring ways to widen my knowledge and creative abilities. 
- ⚙️ Python, & JS are some of the languages I know. 
- 🪛 I also dabble in website making with HTML, & CSS. 

Fun fact, my interest in programming has stemmed from me wanting to create moderation bots for the chatapp, Discord. It has widened since with me wanting to further my knowledge due to my high-school projects.
You can find some of them listed on my GitHub. And my enthusiasm in designing followed suit from my programming while looking at designs that weren't really eye-pleasing with a want to improve them in my way.
