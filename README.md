# Hey there! 👋🏼
I'm **Hemanth Tenneti**, an enthusiast in design and intermediate programmer here to find ways to improve.
Here's some things about me,
- 📑 I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student.
- ✨ Exploring ways to widen my knowledge and creative abilities. 
- ⚙️ Python, & JS are languages I'm comfortable with.
- 🪛 I also dabble in website making with HTML, & CSS. 

Fun fact, my interest in programming has stemmed from me wanting to create moderation bots for the chatapp, Discord. It has widened since with me wanting to further my knowledge due to my high-school projects.
You can find some of them listed on my GitHub. And my enthusiasm in designing followed suit from my programming when I got into Figma.
